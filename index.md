**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**  
I have found Yao's Minimax theorem to be the most interesting thing I have
encountered in the field of Mathematical Computer Science in quite a while. The
idea that I can easilty relate lower bounds on deterministic algorithms to
those on any and all random algorithm has helped to change my perspective on
what a random algorithm even is, and how to think of randomness in the context
of algorithmic design.  
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**  
Thusfar I am moast interested in cryptography, as I find this field to be
interesting on it's own merits while also having some very cool relations to
that of communication comlexity in ways not normaly used by either field.  
**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  
I think that this specific capstone could perhaps have used more than the two
quarters allocated too it, and it would have been nice to have tried meeting
over the summer in advance of the school year starting, to allow us to get a
better grounding of the field and have more that we might understand before
starting the school year.  
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  
It is nearly impossible to say what techniques I might use in my final project,
as proving and analizing things is very specific to the thing that you are
proving, and thus cannot be well anticipated in advance. I would hope to be
able to apply the Minimax theorem as above, or perhaps one of the np-hard
problems as embeddings in a larger problem to prove a lower bound, but I cannot
yet say if those will be useful.
